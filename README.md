# Mock
Mock is a command-line "tool" for converting text into mOcKiNg CaSe TeXt as is often seen with the Mocking SpongeBob meme.

There are (probably) lots of things called Mock. Maybe I'll rename this eventually. For now I want to be able to `mock` things in my terminal.

## Requirements
Go 1.10 or later is required since this uses `strings.Builder`.

> But I haven't made the switch, yet.

## Examples
1. I want to mock stuff in an unremarkable way.
```
$ mock I am boring.
I aM bOrInG.
```
2. I want to mock things with apostrophes.
```
$ mock "I can't write a sentence without apostrophes."
I cAn'T wRiTe A sEnTeNcE wItHoUt ApOsTrOpHeS.
```
